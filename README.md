# 📊 coolMath — Visual Math & Simulations

Welcome to **coolMath** — a vibrant math lab-in-code where **visualizations**, **simulations**, and **intuition-building experiments** bring abstract math topics to life.

This repo is for curious minds who don't just want to *solve* equations, but want to *see* them breathe.

---

## 🎯 Goal

To build a collection of interactive, intuitive, and visual demos for core mathematical areas used in AI, physics, and theoretical CS. Perfect for students, researchers, or the simply math-curious!

## 🔬 Topics Covered

Each module will contain:

- 📈 Visual explanations
- 💡 Intuitive notes
- 🔁 Simulations/animations
- 🧠 Conceptual experiments
- 📚 Links to papers and real-world applications

> **Note**: The numbers next to topics in the notebook are our internal time estimates and can be ignored here.

### 1. Linear Algebra  
Eigenvectors dancing, matrix transformations twisting space, and more.

### 2. Random Processes  
From Brownian motion to Markov chains — we simulate randomness like a chaotic orchestra.

### 3. Concentration Inequalities  
Visualizing how probability tails vanish — with Chebyshev, Hoeffding, and friends.

### 4. Fourier Analysis  
Sound waves, image compression, and neural PDE solvers — watch signals morph.

### 5. Numerical Analysis  
Root-finding, interpolation, and solving systems — all brought to life pixel by pixel.

### 6. Convex Optimization  
Descent paths, saddle points, and duality — visual tools for deep learning fundamentals.

### 7. Information Theory & Entropy  
Bit by bit, visualizing entropy, KL divergence, and mutual information.

### 8. Graph Theory & Spectral Graph Theory  
Networks, Laplacians, and eigenvalue magic — all glowing with spectral insight.

### 9. Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)  
Heat flow, wave equations, and neural PDE solvers, simulated in real time.

### 10. Dynamical Systems  
Phase portraits, chaos, bifurcations — the playground of motion and math.

### 11. Differential Geometry  
Curved spaces, manifolds, and geodesics — understanding shapes beneath AI models.
